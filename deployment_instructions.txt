How to deploy the Gobbler
================================
-We have this system running on a Digital Ocean droplet.

Prerequisites:
  - npm install -g mupx
  - ensure mup.json and settings.json exist in gobbler project folder
    - if these files do not yet exist, you need to 'mupx init' inside gobbler

- mup.json is filled with deployment settings. These settings may need to be modifed for your server.
  - Settings include environment variables which will hold secret API keys and other important data.
  


- after setting all variables in mup.json run: "mupx setup"
-assuming all goes well, to deploy, run: "mupx deploy"

-Should be live...
